# Principal Component Analysis

## Introduction
PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis, which is a widely used statistical technique in data analysis and machine learning. PCA is a method for reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset while retaining the most important information contained in the original dataset.

In PCA, the data is transformed into a new coordinate system in such a way that the first coordinate (called the first principal component) explains the maximum variance in the data, the second coordinate (called the second principal component) explains the maximum remaining variance, and so on. Each principal component is a linear combination of the original variables in the dataset.

PCA is often used in exploratory data analysis to visualize high-dimensional datasets in two or three dimensions, as well as in machine learning tasks such as feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. By reducing the dimensionality of the data, PCA can improve the performance and efficiency of machine learning models.
