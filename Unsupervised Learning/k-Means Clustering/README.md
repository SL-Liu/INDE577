# k-Means Clustering

## Introduction
k-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is used to partition a given dataset into k clusters or groups. It is an iterative algorithm that works by first randomly selecting k initial centroids (points) from the dataset and then assigning each data point to its nearest centroid. The mean of all data points assigned to a particular centroid is then used to update its position. This process is repeated iteratively until the centroids no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
