## Introduction

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models can learn patterns and relationships from data without guidance. Unlike supervised learning, which involves training a model using labeled data, unsupervised learning requires finding patterns and relationships in unlabeled data.

The goal of unsupervised learning is usually to discover underlying structures or patterns in the data, such as identifying clusters of similar data points or finding low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. Unsupervised learning techniques include clustering, downscaling, and generative models.
