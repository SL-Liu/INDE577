## Introduction
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. It is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not assume any underlying distribution of the data.

The KNN algorithm works by finding the k-nearest data points to a given query point in the feature space, where k is a user-defined parameter. The distance between the query point and the data points is typically measured using the Euclidean distance metric, although other distance metrics can also be used.


## Data

'diabetes.csv' is the dataset used:

It multi-class classification dataset. It has 9 columns and the last one is outcome label.
