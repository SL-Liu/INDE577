## Introduction
Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple individual models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the overall prediction. The idea is to combine the predictions of different models to create a single, more accurate prediction.

Ensemble learning can be used in both supervised and unsupervised learning problems. In supervised learning, ensemble methods are used to combine the outputs of multiple models trained on the same dataset, while in unsupervised learning, they are used to combine the outputs of different clustering or anomaly detection algorithms.

There are several types of ensemble learning methods, including:

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): In this method, multiple models are trained on different subsets of the data, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all models.

Boosting: This method combines several weak learners to create a strong learner. The idea is to train models sequentially, where each new model tries to improve the errors made by the previous model.

Stacking: This method involves training multiple models, and then using the output of those models as input to a new model. The new model is then trained to make the final prediction.

Ensemble learning has been shown to be effective in improving the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. It is widely used in various applications, such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
