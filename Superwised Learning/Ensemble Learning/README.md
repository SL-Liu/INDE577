## Introduction
Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple individual models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the overall prediction. The idea is to combine the predictions of different models to create a single, more accurate prediction.

Ensemble learning can be used in both supervised and unsupervised learning problems. In supervised learning, ensemble methods are used to combine the outputs of multiple models trained on the same dataset, while in unsupervised learning, they are used to combine the outputs of different clustering or anomaly detection algorithms.
