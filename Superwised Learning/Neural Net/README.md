## INtroduction
MLP refers to Multilayer Perceptron, a common artificial neural network model. It consists of one or more neural network layers, where each layer contains multiple neurons (or nodes), each of which is connected to all neurons in the previous layer. MLP is commonly used to solve classification and regression problems, and its training process is based on a back-propagation algorithm that can be used to adjust the weight of each neuron to minimize the loss function by back-propagating the error. MLP has a wide range of applications in various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
