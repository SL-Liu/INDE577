# Superwised Learning


## Introduction
Supervised learning is good at classification and regression problems, such as determining what category a news article belongs to or predicting the volume of sales for a given future date. In supervised learning, the aim is to make sense of data within the context of a specific question.
### How does supervised learning work?
Like all machine learning algorithms, supervised learning is based on training. During its training phase, the system is fed with labeled data sets, which instruct the system what output is related to each specific input value. The trained model is then presented with test data: This is data that has been labeled, but the labels have not been revealed to the algorithm. The aim of the testing data is to measure how accurately the algorithm will perform on unlabeled data.
