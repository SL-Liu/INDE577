### Introduction
Gradient descent algorithm is an optimization algorithm that is commonly used to train machine learning models and neural networks. Over time, the training data helps these models learn, and the cost function in the gradient descent algorithm acts as a barometer that measures its accuracy through each iteration of parameter updates. Until the function approaches or equals zero, the model will continuously adjust its parameters so that the resulting error is as small as possible.

### Data
This data is about people's YearsExperience and Salary. There are 30 samples and 2 variables. 
I used simple linear regression model with gradient descent on this data.
