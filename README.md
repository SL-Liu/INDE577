# INDE577 Data Science and Machine Learning

## Repository Description
This repository is about code assignments for Rice University's Spring 2023 INDE577 which includes all topics taught by INDE577 and many datasets for each algorithm. Each algorithm covered in the course is implemented on a dataset. We are studying data science, machine learning, and Python-based applications in this course. The algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning are covered in this data science course.
