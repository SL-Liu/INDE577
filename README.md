# INDE577

## Course Description
The algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and, if time allows, reinforcement learning are covered in this data science course. By using the Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow libraries, we will develop numerous machine learning methods from scratch.


## Course Instructor
Randy R. Davila
