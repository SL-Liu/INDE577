## Introduction

Linear regression is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line to the observed data points. The primary goal of linear regression is to find the best linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables by minimizing the distance between the predicted and actual values.

## Data

In this dataset,many variables can be regarded as variables which might influence house prices:

crime rate: Does the lower the crime rate around the house, the higher the price of the house?

air qual: The better the air quality around the house, the higher the price of the house?

room num: Does the higher the number of rooms in a house, the higher the price of the house?

age:Does the younger the home, the higher the price of the home?

airport: Is there a differece between price of houses with airport aound and those without airport aroud?

waterbody:Is there a differece between price of houses with different waterbody aound?

In addtion, there might be a relation between the house price and other factor like poor proportion.
