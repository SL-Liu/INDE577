MLP refers to Multilayer Perceptron, a common artificial neural network model. It consists of one or more neural network layers, where each layer contains multiple neurons (or nodes), each of which is connected to all neurons in the previous layer. MLP is commonly used to solve classification and regression problems, and its training process is based on a back-propagation algorithm that can be used to adjust the weight of each neuron to minimize the loss function by back-propagating the error. MLP has a wide range of applications in various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Data

Kuzushiji-MNIST is a handwritten digital image dataset consisting of numbers in 10 categories, similar to the traditional MNIST dataset. The difference is that the numbers in the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset are written in Japanese hiragana (Kuzushiji) rather than Arabic numerals. This dataset was launched by the Japan Cultural Heritage Digitization Project to provide researchers with a dataset for research and development of digitization techniques for historical and cultural heritage.

The Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
