# Perceptron

## Introduction
Perceptron is a binary linear classifier, which is one of the basic building blocks of neural networks. It was proposed by American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, and is a machine learning algorithm based on the perceptron algorithm.The Perceptron algorithm is based on a set of input features and binary classifies the input data by learning a set of weights.The learning process of the Perceptron algorithm is iterative, and the classifier is gradually optimized by continuously adjusting the weights The learning process of the Perceptron algorithm is iterative, gradually optimizing the performance of the classifier by continuously adjusting the weights.

The input layer of the Perceptron algorithm accepts a vector as input, each input is multiplied by a weight, and all results are summed to obtain a weighted sum. The Perceptron algorithm can handle linearly separable problems, where there is a hyperplane that completely separates the positive and negative data. If the data is linearly indistinguishable, the Perceptron algorithm stops after a finite number of iterations and yields a model that cannot correctly classify all the data.
